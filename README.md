Course Project README
=====================

This GitHub repo is for ["Getting and Cleaning Data"](https://class.coursera.org/getdata-006/) course project. It includes seven files: `README.md`, `README.html`, `CodeBook.md`, `CodeBook.html`, `run_analysis.R`, `prepared_data.txt`, `tidy_data.txt`. Due to the large size of the data files, it does not include zipped data file or unzipped data in a directory.

* `README.md` (this file): explains what is in this repo.
* `README.html`: the HTML generated from markdown file, `README.md`.

* `CodeBook.html`: the HTML generated from markdown file, `CodeBook.md`.
* `run_analysis.R`: does the work specified in project assignment. In general, it gets the data from internet and converts data to tidy format. The detail is explained in `CodeBook.md`.
* `prepared_data.txt`: prepared one data set contains selected features (the mean and standard deviation of each measurement) of both train and test data.
